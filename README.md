# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This project presents analysis on a large set of crowdfunding projects. The data we will be working with is from an American public benefit corporation, Kickstarter, that maintains a global crowdfunding platform focused on creativity. 
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to reveal any potenial trends, with an emphasis on determining how different Kickstarter campaigns perform in relation to their launch date along with their funding goals.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Theater Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Projects have the greatest chance of succeeding (75%) given their goal is no greater than $4,999. They maintain a fairly even chance of success when a goal is set between $5,000 and $25,000. The dropoff is considerasble after $25,000, and very few projects set such goals.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Just 4% of projects set a goal greater than $25,000, hence drawing a precise and accurate conclusion that such are less likely to met their goal is a limitation. This may be a result of past Kickstarter campiagns failed given higher goals, but the data is unavaiable given our resources.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We could create a graph to resemble the count of total prjects based on the range of their goals. This would help visualize the limitation posed above.
